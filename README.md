# Portfolio
In this project, we have to implement a matrix system based on its order. The matrix must be square (i.e. rows and columns must be the same). The program initially asks the user to enter the order (N) of matrix A and its elements. The program presents the user with a choice (1- 7) to perform specific tasks given below.
1.	To display a matrix
2.	To check whether the entered matrix is symmetric or not
3.	To check whether the entered matrix is an identity matrix or not.
4.	To determine the determinant of the entered matrix.
5.	To determine the adjoint of an entered matrix.
6.	To determine the inverse of an entered matrix.
7.	To determine the solution of the entered matrix (i.e., solving multiple linear equations simultaneously)
8.	To Arithmetic
